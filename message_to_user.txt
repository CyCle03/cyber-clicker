I am still waiting for your instruction on how to proceed with the `git push` command. As mentioned, it failed due to an authentication error. I've provided instructions on how to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitHub.

Please provide the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) if you wish for me to push the changes, or let me know if you prefer to handle the `git push` yourself from your local machine.

I cannot proceed until I receive your decision.
